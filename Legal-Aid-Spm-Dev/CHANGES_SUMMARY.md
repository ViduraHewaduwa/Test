### ✅ New Files Created

1. **`Server/railway.json`** - Railway build configuration
2. **`Server/Procfile`** - Tells Railway how to start your app
3. **`Server/.gitignore`** - Prevents sensitive files from being uploaded
4. **`Server/.env.example`** - Template for environment variables
5. **`Client/config/api.config.ts`** - Centralized API URL configuration
6. **`RAILWAY_SETUP.md`** - Complete deployment guide
7. **`QUICK_DEPLOY.md`** - Quick reference cheat sheet

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Development Mode (Local Testing)
```
Mobile App → http://localhost:3000 (or your local IP)
```

### Production Mode (After Railway Deployment)
```
Mobile App → https://your-app.railway.app
```

The switch happens **automatically** based on `__DEV__` flag in React Native!

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. **First Time Setup (Do Once)**

```powershell
# Commit changes
cd c:\Users\User\Documents\GitHub\test\Legal-Aid-Spm-Dev
git add .
git commit -m "Configure Railway deployment"
git push origin Dev

# Deploy to Railway
# Follow steps in QUICK_DEPLOY.md
```

### 2. **Update Mobile App Config**

After deploying to Railway, update ONE file:

**`Client/config/api.config.ts`** - Line 7:
```typescript
const PRODUCTION_URL = 'https://your-actual-railway-url.railway.app';
```

### 3. **Test Everything**

```powershell
# Test backend
https://your-railway-url.railway.app/health

# Test mobile app
cd Client
npm start
```

## 🔑 Required Environment Variables

You'll need to set these in Railway:

```env
PORT=3000                              # Railway sets this automatically
NODE_ENV=production                    # Tell app it's production
DB_URL=mongodb+srv://...              # Your MongoDB Atlas connection
GEMINI_API_KEY=...                    # Google Gemini AI key
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=...             # Cloudinary account
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=...                # Cloudinary key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=...             # Cloudinary secret
JWT_SECRET=...                        # Random 32+ character string
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Don't commit `.env` file** - It's in `.gitignore` now ✅
2. **MongoDB must allow 0.0.0.0/0** - Required for Railway
3. **Update mobile app URL** - After getting Railway domain
4. **Cloudinary handles files** - Railway doesn't store uploads
5. **Auto-deploy enabled** - Push to GitHub = automatic deploy

---

- Keep Railway dashboard open to check logs
- Test locally first before deploying
- MongoDB Atlas free tier is perfect for testing
- Cloudinary free tier handles ~100GB/month traffic

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

1. **Check Railway logs** - Dashboard → Deployments → View Logs
2. **Verify env variables** - All keys set correctly?
3. **Test MongoDB** - Can you connect from MongoDB Compass?
4. **Check Cloudinary** - Are credentials correct?
5. **CORS issues?** - Make sure Railway URL is in mobile app config
