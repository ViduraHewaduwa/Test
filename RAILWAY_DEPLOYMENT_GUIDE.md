## ðŸŽ¯ Step 5: Test Your Deployment

1. **Check deployment status:**
   - Look at the "Deployments" tab in Railway
   - Wait for the status to show "Success" (green checkmark)
   - If it fails, check the logs for errors

2. **Test your API endpoints:**
   
   Open your browser and visit:
   
   ```
   https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/health
   ```
   
   You should see:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "OK",
     "timestamp": "2025-10-17T...",
     "uptime": 123.456,
     "mongodb": "connected",
     "geminiApiKey": "configured"
   }
   ```

3. **Test the main endpoint:**
   ```
   https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/
   ```
   
   You should see the API documentation with all available endpoints.

## ðŸ“± Step 6: Configure Your Mobile App

Now you need to connect your React Native/Expo mobile app to the Railway-hosted backend.

### Method 1: Using Environment Variables (Recommended)

1. **Create a config file for your API URL:**

   Create `Client/config/api.ts`:
   ```typescript
   const API_URL = __DEV__ 
     ? 'http://localhost:3000'  // Local development
     : 'https://your-app-name.up.railway.app';  // Production (Railway)

   export default API_URL;
   ```

2. **Update your service files to use this config:**

   In all your service files (e.g., `Client/services/documentService.ts`), replace hardcoded URLs:

   ```typescript
   // Before:
   // const response = await axios.get('http://localhost:3000/api/documents');

   // After:
   import API_URL from '../config/api';
   const response = await axios.get(`${API_URL}/api/documents`);
   ```

### Method 2: Using Environment Variables with Expo

1. **Create `Client/.env` file:**
   ```env
   EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-app-name.up.railway.app
   ```

2. **Install dotenv:**
   ```bash
   cd Client
   npm install react-native-dotenv
   ```

3. **Update `Client/babel.config.js`:**
   ```javascript
   module.exports = function(api) {
     api.cache(true);
     return {
       presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
       plugins: [
         ['module:react-native-dotenv', {
           moduleName: '@env',
           path: '.env',
         }]
       ]
     };
   };
   ```

4. **Create `Client/@types/env.d.ts`:**
   ```typescript
   declare module '@env' {
     export const EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL: string;
   }
   ```

5. **Use in your services:**
   ```typescript
   import { EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL } from '@env';
   const API_URL = EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL || 'http://localhost:3000';
   ```

---

## ðŸ“± Step 7: Test on Your Mobile Phone

### Option A: Using Expo Go App (Easiest)

1. **Install Expo Go on your phone:**
   - iOS: Download from App Store
   - Android: Download from Play Store

2. **Start your development server:**
   ```bash
   cd Client
   npm start
   ```

3. **Scan the QR code:**
   - On your phone, open Expo Go
   - Scan the QR code from the terminal
   - Make sure your phone and computer are on the same WiFi network

4. **Your app should now load and connect to Railway backend!**

### Option B: Building a Standalone App

For a production-ready mobile app:

1. **For Android (APK):**
   ```bash
   cd Client
   npx expo build:android
   ```

2. **For iOS (requires Apple Developer account):**
   ```bash
   cd Client
   npx expo build:ios
   ```

3. **Or use EAS Build (recommended by Expo):**
   ```bash
   npm install -g eas-cli
   eas build --platform android
   eas build --platform ios
   ```

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. **MongoDB Connection Failed**
   - âœ… Check your connection string in Railway variables
   - âœ… Ensure you whitelisted `0.0.0.0/0` in MongoDB Atlas Network Access
   - âœ… Verify your database user credentials are correct

#### 2. **API Returns 404 Not Found**
   - âœ… Ensure Root Directory is set to `Server` in Railway settings
   - âœ… Check deployment logs for errors
   - âœ… Verify your Railway URL is correct (with https://)

#### 3. **CORS Errors from Mobile App**
   - âœ… The server already has CORS configured
   - âœ… Make sure you're using the exact Railway URL (including https://)
   - âœ… Check that the URL doesn't have a trailing slash

#### 4. **File Uploads Not Working**
   - âœ… Configure Cloudinary properly (recommended for Railway)
   - âœ… Check that environment variables are set correctly
   - âœ… Railway ephemeral filesystem means local uploads won't persist - use Cloudinary!

#### 5. **Mobile App Can't Connect to Backend**
   - âœ… Verify the API_URL in your app matches your Railway URL
   - âœ… Check your phone has internet connection
   - âœ… Test the Railway endpoint in a browser first
   - âœ… Make sure you rebuilt/restarted the Expo app after changing the URL

#### 6. **Railway Deployment Keeps Failing**
   - âœ… Check the deployment logs in Railway
   - âœ… Ensure all dependencies are in package.json
   - âœ… Verify Node.js version compatibility
   - âœ… Check that environment variables are set correctly
